# <b>Consolidation Project: One Sleepless Night</b>
## An Interactive Video Narrative

This is the repository for my consolidation project in Composing Digital Media (Spring 2021). Because the rationale behind the project is to explore the affordances of digital media topics discussed throughout the semester and integrate such skills into a collaborative digital project, I, along with my teammate Thomas, have decided to compose an interactive video that would incoporate visual principles, sound design, and web development aspects. All components for the project are explained below. *For more information regarding the assignment, please refer [here](https://benmiller314.github.io/cdm2021spring/projects).*

### Project Proposal

For my consolidation project, I want to take a new approach to the various forms of digital media we've explored throughout the semester (e.g. audio, visual, and web) by creating an interactive video. I'm not necessarily sure what the narrative will revolve around yet, but the audience will watch short POV clips and be asked to make decisions that would impact the story of the protagonist. For instance, if the protagonist is walking in a park and the path forks, the audience will be asked to choose whether the protagonist should follow the right or left path. While I've had experience with film before, I've never attempted a project in this format and have little experience working with action cameras, so I'm really excited to see how I'm able to refine my skills and apply my current knowledge in a different medium. Because the project is relatively ambitious, I've decided to work in a group with Thomas Brusilovsky(@TBrusilovsky).

*Tasks List:*
- CC audio snippets for sound design
- GoPro Kit
- Adobe Premiere Pro + After Effects(?) for editing
- Audacity to refine sound effects
- Webpage in HTML/CSS and JavaScript

### Preview â€” 4/20/21

For the preview, Thomas and I decided to divide the work in order to achieve as much as posisble by the end of the semester. As such, because I have a background in film, I decided to handle the production and sound design of the video snippets while Thomas is responsible for implementing the structure of the web pages necessary to make the clips interactive. I was able to borrow the GoPro kit from Hillman Library and plan to shoot sometime within the next couple of days (assuming the weather is suitable). In the meantime, I've drafted a flowchart of the possible choices and narrative that the videos will follow. My intention is to finalize the flowchart during studio time in today's class and to ask Thomas for any feedback he can provide with it.
