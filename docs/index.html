          <br> 
          An Interactive Video Narrative
        </h3>
        
        <h4>By Thomas Brusilovsky and Caela Go</h4>
        <small>For our consolidation project, we wanted to take a new approach to the various forms of 
            digital media we've explored throughout 
            the semester (e.g. audio, visual, and web) by creating an  
            interactive video. We wanted to combine various skills that we practiced 
            throughout the semester, such as audio editing and website design,
            but also combine them with our past experiences, such as Caela's film studies
            and Thomas's coding experience. With as little time as we had available,
            we still wanted something cool as an end result and the product you see here before you
            is what we managed to achieve. To view the interactive video, click the button above.
